# Releasing

## 1. Checking bugs and technical debt

### Lint checks

Android development tools provide linter to check common errors.
Use `./gradlew :app:lint` to run the linter and produce (human readable) reports as HTML file located at `app/build/reports/lint-results.html`.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Check no new warning was introduced before releasing.

### SonarCloud analysis

The AdAway application source code is [analyzed by SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=org.adaway) to find bugs, code smells and compute technical debt.
While the overall score may be not perfect, each new release should not increase it.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Check no new bug nor debt was introduced before releasing.

## 2. Updating application version

Each version has its own number that follows the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) principle (starting from version 4).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Update application version name (`appName`) and code (`appCode`) from the `gradle/libs.versions.toml` catalog file.

## 3. Updating the changelog

The AdAway project provides [a global changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Update the changelog to let users know what is inside each new version before releasing it.

## 4. Building release APK

Tagged GitHub releases build the `directRelease` variant with
`.github/workflows/fork-release-apk.yml`. The release artifact name is
`AdAway_<version>.apk`, where `<version>` is the tag without the leading `v`.
For example, tag `v13.5.0` produces `AdAway_13.5.0.apk`.

The workflow also generates `app/build/reports/sbom/adaway.cdx.json`,
SHA-256 checksum files for the APK, signed manifest, and SBOM,
signer-certificate verification, provenance attestations for all six uploaded
assets, and the SBOM predicate attestation. After the attestations are created,
the workflow re-runs the canonical artifact verifier with
`--verify-attestations` before creating the GitHub Release.

Required repository secrets:

| Secret | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | Base64-encoded release keystore |
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | Keystore password |
| `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` | Release key alias |
| `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` | Release key password |
| `UPDATE_MANIFEST_PUBLIC_KEY_BASE64` | Public key embedded for signed update-manifest verification |
| `UPDATE_MANIFEST_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64` | Base64-encoded PEM private key used to sign `manifest.json` |
| `ANDROID_RELEASE_CERT_SHA256` | Expected APK signing certificate SHA-256 digest |
| `RELEASE_TAG_PUBLIC_KEY_BASE64` | Base64-encoded public key used by `git verify-tag` for release tags |

Local release verification should run the same gates where possible:

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleDirectRelease --dependency-verification=strict --no-daemon --stacktrace
./gradlew :app:generateSbom --dependency-verification=strict --no-daemon --stacktrace
```

## 5. Distributing release

Before sharing the any release, remember to test it.
Release variant apk does not behave like debug variant.
Same goes for real device versus emulator.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Final tests should be done with release apk variant on real device.

Once tested, releases are posted on XDA development thread using the following template:
```

### Beta releases

The beta releases are only announced in the XDA development thread.

### Stable releases

Fork release tags publish the direct APK through
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/stevesolun/AdAway/releases). Store
releases such as F-Droid are separate store/build-pipeline work and should use
the normal `release` variant, not the direct APK updater variant.
Once ready, create and push a signed tag on this GitHub repository using
`vX.Y.Z` format (or `vX.Y.Zb` for pre-releases). Tags ending in `b` are
published as GitHub pre-releases and use the `beta` update-manifest channel;
all other release tags use the `stable` channel. The workflow imports
`RELEASE_TAG_PUBLIC_KEY_BASE64`, runs `git verify-tag`, creates the GitHub
release with fixed GPL boundary wording, disables generated release notes, and
uploads:

* `AdAway_<version>.apk`
* `AdAway_<version>.apk.sha256`
* `manifest.json`
* `manifest.json.sha256`
* `app/build/reports/sbom/adaway.cdx.json`
* `app/build/reports/sbom/adaway.cdx.json.sha256`

Before pushing a release tag locally, run:

```powershell
$Version = "<version>"
$Apk = "app\build\outputs\apk\directRelease\AdAway_$Version.apk"
$Sbom = "app\build\reports\sbom\adaway.cdx.json"
$Manifest = "app\build\outputs\update\manifest.json"

./gradlew :app:assembleDirectRelease --dependency-verification=strict --no-daemon --stacktrace
./gradlew :app:generateSbom --dependency-verification=strict --no-daemon --stacktrace
Copy-Item app\build\outputs\apk\directRelease\app-directRelease.apk $Apk -Force
Get-FileHash $Apk -Algorithm SHA256 |
  ForEach-Object { "$($_.Hash.ToLowerInvariant())  $(Split-Path $Apk -Leaf)" } |
  Set-Content "$Apk.sha256"
Get-FileHash $Sbom -Algorithm SHA256 |
  ForEach-Object { "$($_.Hash.ToLowerInvariant())  $(Split-Path $Sbom -Leaf)" } |
  Set-Content "$Sbom.sha256"
.\scripts\generate-update-manifest.ps1 `
  --apk $Apk `
  --version $Version `
  --version-code "<versionCode>" `
  --cert-sha256 "<release-certificate-sha256>" `
  --apk-url "https://github.com/stevesolun/AdAway/releases/download/v$Version/$(Split-Path $Apk -Leaf)" `
  --private-key-base64 "$env:UPDATE_MANIFEST_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64" `
  --public-key-base64 "$env:UPDATE_MANIFEST_PUBLIC_KEY_BASE64" `
  --out $Manifest `
  --channel stable `
  --store adaway
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\check-license-boundary.ps1 `
  -SourceMode GitTracked -StrictSourceArchive `
  -ApkPath $Apk `
  -SbomPath $Sbom `
  -StrictArtifacts `
  -ReportPath artifact-license-boundary-report.md
.\scripts\run-release-smoke.ps1 `
  -ApkPath $Apk `
  -ExpectedCertSha256 "<release-certificate-sha256>" `
  -VerifyOnly
.\scripts\run-release-smoke.ps1 `
  -ApkPath $Apk `
  -ExpectedCertSha256 "<release-certificate-sha256>"
```

`generate-update-manifest.ps1` and `generate-update-manifest.sh` both delegate
to the same JDK-based manifest generator, so local Windows verification does not
require WSL, Bash, or OpenSSL. The release workflow still invokes the Bash
wrapper on GitHub-hosted Linux runners.

`run-release-smoke.ps1 -VerifyOnly` checks release APK badging and optional
signer identity without requiring a connected device, and writes the APK
SHA-256 plus signer certificate status when `-ReportPath` is provided. The full
`run-release-smoke.ps1` command still refuses debuggable APKs and emulators,
installs the release APK on an attached physical device, launches `org.adaway`,
and fails if the process is not running after launch.

The same full device smoke can be run from the manual **Physical release smoke**
workflow (`.github/workflows/physical-release-smoke.yml`). Use a self-hosted
runner labeled `android-device` with PowerShell, GitHub CLI, `adb`, Android
build-tools, and one attached physical device, or provide the optional
`device_serial` input when several physical devices are attached. The workflow downloads
`AdAway_<version>.apk` from the provided release tag and runs
`run-release-smoke.ps1` without `-VerifyOnly`. A successful run uploads the
`physical-release-smoke-report` artifact with the release tag, APK name,
APK SHA-256, signing certificate identity, physical device status, hashed
device serial, and observed launch pid.

On Unix-like shells with PowerShell available, the boundary checker wrapper can
also be run directly:

```bash
bash ./scripts/check-license-boundary.sh -SourceMode GitTracked -StrictSourceArchive
```

The regular Android CI workflow uploads the source boundary report as
`license-boundary-report`. Tagged direct-APK releases upload
`release-license-boundary-reports`, including source and APK/SBOM artifact
boundary reports.

Use the tagged release artifact boundary report, not the regular CI source-only
report, when running `verify-release-readiness.ps1`. The final readiness check
expects the generated `verify-release-artifacts` report with
`Checksum verification: passed`, `Manifest signature: passed`,
`Manifest payload: passed`, a checked `Expected certificate SHA-256`, and the
release tag inferred from the signed manifest APK URL; it also expects
`Strict artifacts: true` plus the same APK and SBOM artifact names from the
release artifact verification report.
The physical smoke report must be generated by `run-release-smoke.ps1` in
physical-device mode and include `Package`, `Signer certificate check: True`,
`Signer certificate SHA-256`, `Release tag`, `Device serial SHA-256`, and
`Launch pid observed`.
The UX sign-off report must be generated by `verify-ux-signoff.ps1` and include
a reviewer, review packet, `Review packet SHA-256`, checked item count,
`Unchecked items: 0`, and `Issues: 0`.
The generated readiness report repeats release tag, APK, APK SHA-256, SBOM, and
UX review packet hash, then records SHA-256 hashes for the release artifact,
physical smoke, UX sign-off, and license-boundary proof reports it consumed.

The final aggregation can also be run in GitHub Actions from the manual
**Verify release readiness** workflow
(`.github/workflows/verify-release-readiness.yml`). Provide the run IDs that
uploaded `release-artifact-verification-report`,
`physical-release-smoke-report`, and `release-license-boundary-reports`, plus
`ux_signoff_report_base64`, the base64-encoded `ux-signoff-report.md` generated
by `verify-ux-signoff.ps1`. The workflow downloads the proof artifacts, runs
`verify-release-readiness.ps1`, and uploads the final
`release-readiness-report` artifact.

After the GitHub release is published, download the six uploaded assets to a
clean checkout and verify them as a single artifact set. With
`--verify-attestations`, the verifier checks GitHub attestations for the APK,
signed manifest, SBOM, and each `.sha256` checksum sidecar:

The same post-publish check can be run in GitHub Actions from the manual
**Verify release artifacts** workflow (`.github/workflows/verify-release-artifacts.yml`).
Provide the release tag and expected APK signing certificate SHA-256 digest;
the workflow downloads the six release assets, verifies manifest/signature and
checksum semantics, verifies GitHub attestations against this repository, and
uploads a `release-artifact-verification-report` artifact.

```powershell
$Version = "<version>"
$Apk = "AdAway_$Version.apk"
.\scripts\verify-release-artifacts.ps1 `
  --apk $Apk `
  --apk-sha256 "$Apk.sha256" `
  --manifest manifest.json `
  --manifest-sha256 manifest.json.sha256 `
  --sbom adaway.cdx.json `
  --sbom-sha256 adaway.cdx.json.sha256 `
  --public-key-base64 "$env:UPDATE_MANIFEST_PUBLIC_KEY_BASE64" `
  --expected-version $Version `
  --expected-channel stable `
  --expected-store adaway `
  --expected-apk-url "https://github.com/stevesolun/AdAway/releases/download/v$Version/$Apk" `
  --expected-cert-sha256 "<release-certificate-sha256>" `
  --repo stevesolun/AdAway `
  --report verification-report.md `
  --verify-attestations
```

On Unix-like shells:

```bash
VERSION="<version>"
APK="AdAway_${VERSION}.apk"
bash ./scripts/verify-release-artifacts.sh \
  --apk "$APK" \
  --apk-sha256 "$APK.sha256" \
  --manifest manifest.json \
  --manifest-sha256 manifest.json.sha256 \
  --sbom adaway.cdx.json \
  --sbom-sha256 adaway.cdx.json.sha256 \
  --public-key-base64 "$UPDATE_MANIFEST_PUBLIC_KEY_BASE64" \
  --expected-version "$VERSION" \
  --expected-channel stable \
  --expected-store adaway \
  --expected-apk-url "https://github.com/stevesolun/AdAway/releases/download/v$VERSION/$APK" \
  --expected-cert-sha256 "<release-certificate-sha256>" \
  --repo stevesolun/AdAway \
  --report verification-report.md \
  --verify-attestations
```

The signed update manifest may only point to `app.adaway.org` or to this fork's
GitHub APK release path:
`https://github.com/stevesolun/AdAway/releases/download/<tag>/<apk>.apk`.
Check the embedded payload before publishing or announcing a release.

Tagged releases are retained for durable provenance; the tagged release workflow
does not automatically delete older release artifacts.

APK self-update is only for the AdAway-signed direct APK distribution. Store
builds such as F-Droid should rely on their store update mechanism rather than
the in-app APK installer path. Build store releases with the normal `release`
variant so the installer permission is absent from the merged manifest; build
only the AdAway-signed direct APK channel with `directRelease`.

Pushing a fork release tag publishes the GitHub direct APK only. F-Droid updates
through its own store/build pipeline; when that pipeline runs, logs are
available at `https://monitor.f-droid.org/builds/log/org.adaway/<versioncode>`.
